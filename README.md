# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
module 13

## Project Overview
Roza and I have created an amazing dashboard to highlight the biodiversity in users' navels. There are three charts below that can help the user identify the top ten bacterial species in their belly button. They can select their  subject id number from the dropdown menu to update the data in the charts. Since some bacterias have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef, they can then use this imformation to potentially work with Impossible Beef on their startup project.
